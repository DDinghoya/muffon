### Good news
The server is working. üéâ

I'm really sorry that you had to wait for quite a long time. There were certain difficulties that didn't allow to restart the project in time.

But now everything's set up and the [new version](https://github.com/staniel359/muffon/releases/tag/v0.1.0) with new features is available now!

And I'm finally coming out of beta, but there may be some bugs, of course.

Also old versions won't work anymore. Please download the newest one.
